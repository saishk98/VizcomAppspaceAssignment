<br><br>
2. Click on the QUICK ACTION menu on the top right and select Create Card.
<br><br>
3. Select Communication from All Templates panel and click on Table.
<br>
4. Configure a Table Card:<ul>
  <li>Documentation Reference: <a href="https://docs.appspace.com/latest/cloud/library/cards/create-tables/">Appspace Table Card</a></li>
  <li>Use the Table Card to create a view of the data sourced from the  <a href="https://dummy-project-status-api.replit.app/api/status"><b>Project Status API</b></a>.</li>
  <li><b>External Data Source</b>: Ensure that your table pulls data dynamically from the <a href="https://dummy-project-status-api.replit.app/api/status"><b>Project Status API</b></a> and updates periodically.</li></ul><br>
5. Apply Conditional Formatting:<ul>
  <li>Implement <b>conditional formatting</b> based on one of the columns in the dataset. For example, highlight rows where the priority is marked as high.</li>
  <li>Apply <b>filters</b> to only show relevant data (e.g., active projects only).</li></ul><br>
6. Design Considerations:<ul>
  <li>Customise the styling and layout of the table using Appspace's card editor, ensuring it is visually appealing and user-friendly.</li>
  <li>Focus on <b>responsiveness</b> and ensure the table displays correctly on different screen sizes.</li></ul><br><br>

<b>My Approach, Challenges Encountered and Solutions Implemented.</b><br>
My approach to doing the Appspace Assignment is by reading the documentation and instructions as provided for me to get a basic understanding of Appspace. One of the challenges I encountered during my implementation is when I attempted to inserted the provided URL (https://dummy-project-status-api.replit.app/api/status) for the data source and ended up with an error stating that the provided URL cannot be previewed in the editor as this is mock data. The Solution I implemented to this problem is gathering the data from the URL and create a new excel spreadsheet to collate data and then import the excel spreadsheet to the table source.
